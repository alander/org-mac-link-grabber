* Overview 

  This code will allow you to grab the current link or selection from
  an open mac application and insert it as a hyperlink at point in an
  org-mode document.

*** Supported Application

	The following applications are currently supported:
	- Finder.app
	- Mail.app
	- Firefox.app
	- Together.app

* Installation
  
  Add the org-mac-link-grabber/lisp directory to your load-path, and
  then add 

  : (require 'org-mac-link-grabber) 

  to your .emacs. You may also optionally bind a key to activate the
  link grabber menu, like this:

  : (add-hook 'org-mode-hook (lambda () 
  :   (define-key org-mode-map (kbd "C-c g") 'omgl-grab-link)))

* Usage 

  Activate the grabber by typing *C-c g* (or whatever key you decided
  to bind, as above), or type *M-x omgl-grab-link*. This will give you
  a menu in the modeline allowing you to select an application. The
  current selection in that application will be inserted at point as a
  hyperlink in your org-mode document.
